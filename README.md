# Kelly Travel - Bus Hire Website
[Link to live site on github pages](https://coder187.github.io/CI_MS1_BusHire/)

Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

The project will produce a simple brochure website for the Limerick based bus hire operator - Kelly Travel.

The idea behind the project is to help support and enhance the companies current web and social media presence via a user friendly & mobile responsive site with some 
basic information on the company and services available.
It is envisaged hat the base system will be extended in future to provide cloud based customer services which will fully integrate with the exist9ng 
IT infrasctructire of the companies backoffice systems via a Full Stack solution.


The end user of the system will be current and potential customers of Kelly Travel.
This includes a very wide range of people, so ease of use and responsive design are of utmost importance.
It is envisaged that the site will encourage interest in the companies services 
from a younger audience as the current site is not fully responsive and so engagement is somewhat diminised.
A modern UX will hopefully bring the companies services to an even wider audience.

# Scope 
## User Stories
1. As a potential customer I want to get contact information for local bus companies.
2. As a potential customer I want information on the type of vehicles available for hire.

# Structure 

## Features
The website consists of 3 pages, home page, fleet page and a quote sent conifrmation page.
Each page features a responsive navigation bar with conventional placing of logo (top left).
Each page has a footer with contact information and social media icons linking to the companies social media accounts. This ensures good UX via a consistent look and feel for the user.
		
The home page has a hero image at the top with a Contact form overlayed ontop and postioned to the lef  of the viewport. 
To the right a brief message welcomes users the site. The purpose of the hero image is to grab attention and give a positive emotional response to the user, 
while having the contact form on top allows the user to request a quote without further navigation.

The qucik quote contact form requests a 
bus size(drop down select), 
date of travel, 
collection point, 
destination, 
contact email and an additional information text area. 
The bottom of the form has a "Get a Free Quote" button. 
When this button is clicked and all the form fields are validated the confirmation page loads with a 
Quote Sent Confirmation message and link back to the home page.

After the hero image there are some key points on why the user should consider this company for their requirements.

Next we have a bright high resolution image of some happy people on a bus to help reinforce the users emotional response.

Following the image we have four animated numerical counters which show further key aspects of the business strengths. 
This is intended to convey information in an effiecnet and pleasing manner.
	
The Fleet section follows, with clear and consice images and text for each category of vehicle available. 
The call to action button leads the user to the Fleet page which has more details on each categroy of vehicles.

The Fleet page is laid out in columns of images and bullet point text with a single columnn for mobile devices, two columns for tablets
and three columns for larger screens. The images are high resolution examples from each vehilce category and 
the text describes the features of each category.

## Technical Capabilites
HTML5 & CSS3 along with Bootstrap 4 framework are my core strengths in regards to this project.

# Surface
## Font 
I have used Google Fonts Roboto & Work Sans, throughout this project as I felt they clearly and efficently communicate their content. 

## Colour Scheme
I wanted the site to immediately feel familiar to exisitng Kelly Travel employees and customers by maintaining the companies long 
held colours of Green, Black & White. Although this maybe a somewhat simple color palette, it does match with company logo, uniform and vehicle livery.
This helps to immediately identify the site as being within the Kelly Travel domain.

## Site Layout
One of the sites main goals is to drive sales, especially from a younger audience whom are more likely to engage with the site via a mobile device.
To encourage call to action I have placed the Quote Form as one of the first elements on the landing page, aswell as including a menu item for the form.
This will help remove any impediments to engaging with the company and make quote request as seamless as possible.

The About section flows naturally below followed by Fleet Profile with Contact information pinned to the footer.

# Bugs
* about section : text not aligned because float had float right instead of left
* fontawesome icons not showing - some fonts were from ver 5. Ver4 and Ver5 have different element link syntax for the same icons
* centering the welcome text div - overwrite bootstrap padding
* centering spinners - text wrapping - add min height
* spinner circle not centered due to large number - add padding-top to circle
* media query 300px not running without !important
* ipad welcome text bleed right margin
* contact form breaks from float right at high resoluutin(above 1869). fix - wrap contact form header and form element in a div and float the div right.
* notice a left - right horizontal scroll - also on demo sites - so possibly not a bug but needs further investiagation.
