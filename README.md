# Kelly Travel - Bus Hire Website

Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

The project will produce a simple brochure website for the Limerick based bus hire opertor - Kelly Travel.

The idea behind the project is to help support and enhance the companies current web and social media presenc via a user friendly  & mobile responsive site with some 
basic information on the company and services offered.

## Showcase
A deployed link to the website can be found here. <link>

# UX

## User Stories
The end user of the system will be current and potential customers of Kelly Travel.
This includes a very wide range of people, so ease of use and responsive design are of utmost importance.

The site will have information on the company including:
* Office Contact Information.
* Emergency Contact Information.
* Brief Fleet Examples.
* A "Quick Quote" form.

It is envisaged that the site will encourage interest in the companies services 
from a younger audience as the current site is not fully responsive and so engagement is somewhat diminised.
A modern UX will hopefully bring the companes services to an even wider audience.

One key requirement is to have a an accessable site.

* As a potential customer I want to get contact information for local bus companies.
* As a potential customer I want information on the type of vehicles available for hire.
* As a potential customer I would like to see the types of journeys catered for.
* As a potential customer I would like to know if the company can provide disability friendly vehicles.
* As a potential customer I want to send a request for a quote for hire via the contact page.
* As a potential customer I want to view timetable data for operated routes.

## Strategy
### User Needs.
The needs of the user is to fulfil the capabilites of using this application on their mobile and tablet devices. 
They need the information to be easily accessible and easy to digest.

### Technical Capabilites
It is envisenged that Bootstrap 4 together with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript will be utilised to create the website in a timely manner. 
Keeping the information seperated but easy to read and designed to pop out for the user so they dont have to look 
too hard for the information. It was not possible to implement mailing servers on this project due to time restrictions and 
was not part of the current scope of the project, but is due to be completed on a future release.

### Business Vision
The purpose of this project is to provide basic information to the general puplic on the services offered by Kelly Travel and 
to provide a seamless user friendly mechanism to make an enqiry via the contact form.

It is envisaged hat the base system will be extended in future updates to provide cloud based customer services which will fully integrate with the exist9ng 
IT infrasctructire of the companes backoffice systems.

## Scope
If they like what they see it promotes further followers on the social media platform and or to get intouch for further information.

## Structure
My structure is layed out as a single page application that has an inviting landing page with quick quote form 
to allow quick and easy enquiries with as little input from the user as possible. 
On the natural flow of the site it brings you to the About Kelly Travel section that gives a quick snippet of the business, 
followed by a quick snippet of the reasons customers choose to travel with us on a regular basis.
Following this you are shown some examples of the avaialble vehicle options with a call to action button "more info.."
The footer that has links to social media platforms.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
