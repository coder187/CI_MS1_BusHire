## Testing planning.
With this project I have use Test [Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) model (TDD).

The TDD method consists of a cycle of :
* write new test
* implement new feature
* run all tests & repeat all steps untill all tests pass.

## Performance
I used Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse to test site performance.
Accessability, Best Pracrtices & SEO scored very highly, however Performance needs further investigation.
I was able to gain slight improvment by using Tiny Png to reduce image sizes.
Lighthouse currently reports a Performance Score of just under 80, which may be partly down to server resources.
